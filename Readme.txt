 My  target was to make use of pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries from python to extract insights from the Seoul bike dataset and make use of Linear Regression,
                   KNN Regressor and Random Forest Regressor using scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.




                  I perform hyperparameter tuning  using grid search cross validation for the Random forest Regressor machine learning model.
                  (due to some time constrained it was not properly run, but i provided code for tuning)

                  Feature Engineering and selection Techniques used:
                             1.file encoding
                             2.parse_date
                             3.Encoding (_one hot encoding_)
                             4.Scaling (_standardization_)
                             5.Normality Test
                             6.Visualization by using different plots
                             7.pearsons correlation coefficient
                   
                   Data do not contain any missing values.
                   Regarding Outliers I tried at my end If I would got a chance, I supposed to be discussed with the domain experts.
